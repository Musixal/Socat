## Installation

To use Socat script, simply download and run the `socat.sh` script. You can download the script from the following link:
```
wget -Nq https://github.com/Musixal/socat/raw/main/socat.sh && bash socat.sh
```
**Unfortunately, IPv6 is not supported in this script. I strongly recommend using HAProxy script.**
